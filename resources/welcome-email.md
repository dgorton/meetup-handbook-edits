### 4. Get Involved
If you want to get the most out of WordPress, we highly recommend you get involved, learn from others and perhaps lend a hand as well. If you are interested in doing presentations or speaking, you do not have to be a world famous expert to do a presentation with us. As long as you have something to share, we’d love to have you present a talk or workshop. Send us a message with your ideas.

### 5. What to I do now
The next thing we want you to do is come along to the next meetup! If you haven’t already, head over to our meetup page and RSVP to an event.

If you have any questions or concerns, please get in touch with one of the organisers or a current member. We’ll be happy to help. We look forward to seeing you and thanks again for becoming a part of our meetup group!
